They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity.

[29] in view of the approach taken by his honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. the court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. we are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. we see no error on the part of his honour. section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of commonwealth parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the constitution : commonwealth bank of australia v heinrich [2000] fca 1255 at [18] [25] per mansfield j. nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of schedule 2 to the human rights and equal opportunity commission act 1986 (cth): hubner v anz banking group ltd [2000] fca 140 at [9] [10], [2000] fca 140 ;

the purpose for doing it remained the same. the tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. it seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 the tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. with the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. there may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, i can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. i again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 it follows that, for the period from 1 july 2000 to 1 july 2002, word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. the cross-appeal is therefore allowed. word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 as set out above at [16], word established the foundation from 1 july 2002 to carry on the business of bethel funerals. this effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when bethel funerals was merely a part of word rather than run through a separate legal entity. the tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 july 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In relation to \\\"substantive unfairness\\\", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In relation to \\\"substantive unfairness\\\", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203\",\n          \"Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574 \",\n          \"Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203\",\n          \"Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574 \",\n          \"Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nouns\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"agreed elements of the action for breach of confidence are, for present purposes, that: (i) the information in question must be confidential in character: it must have \\\"the necessary quality of confidence about it\\\": Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203 at 215; (ii) it must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence: Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 at 47; Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37 at 40; and (iii) there must have been an actual or threatened unauthorised use or disclosure of that information: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 87, 111-112; Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222.

The alternative test the \\\"purpose\\\" test asks: Has confidential information been imparted for what was known, or ought reasonably to have been known, to be only for a particular purpose? If it has, its use must be limited to that purpose. This approach has commonly been used in cases in which confidential industrial information has been disclosed (usually under contract) to a manufacturer either by way of licence for a period or so as to manufacture a product for the confider: see Saltman Engineering , at 213; Nichrotherm Electrical Co Ltd v Percy [1956] RPC 272 at 280; Ackroyds (London) Ltd at 104; Torrington Manufacturing Co Ltd v Smith &amp; Sons (England) Ltd [1966] RPC 285. Its use extends beyond that context: see Interfirm Comparison (Australia) at 117; and Gurry \\\"Breach of Confidence\\\" in Finn (ed) Essays in Equity , 118 (1985); Smith Kline &amp; French , at 96. Turning to the claims against Dr Keung, it is asserted in the alternative that he owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton in virtue of the disclosure actually being made to him and breached that duty by the disclosure he made, or that he knowingly participated in AMC's breach of confidence in that he directed or procured AMC's breach and was liable therefore. I am prepared, for present purposes, to assume that Dr Keung owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. He was the actual recipient of information which he had reason to know was to be kept confidential, albeit he received it for AMC which in turn owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. If, for example, he used such information for his own private purposes which resulted in a gain for him or a loss to Hamilton, he would have been liable therefore at the suit of Hamilton: see Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd , at 213; and without the need for any circularity of action by joining AMC as a party. I need not consider AMC's liability in such a case for present purposes: cf Coulthard v South Australia [1995] SASC 4927 ; (1995) 63 SASR 531 at 535. Equally, I am prepared to assume that he would be liable to Hamilton on an accessorial liability basis for his intentional procurement of AMC's breach of confidence to Hamilton. In this I recognise that there is a significant body of discordant case law across the common law world on the question of the liability of directors who are participants in the wrongs of their company, whether that wrong be a breach of contract, a tort, or an equitable wrong: see the helpful discussion of this in relation to tortious liability in Anderson, \\\"The theory of the corporation and its relevance to directors' tortious liability to creditors\\\" (2004) 16 Aust Jo Corp Law 73; on the small company problem for directors, see Finn, \\\"Opening Remarks\\\" (1999) 27 Fed L Rev 171 at 177-180; see the discussion in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [113] - [147] ; and see Mortimore QC Company Directors Ch 27 (2009 OUP).\",\n          \"The Episodes must be considered in their entirety ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199 per Gibbs CJ). That involves taking account of content and presentation and also the circumstances in which the Episodes were broadcast ( Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574 at [16]). The question for the Court is whether reasonably minded viewers would take from the Episodes the representations which are alleged ( Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45). There is no dispute that viewers would be unlikely to engage in a detailed analysis of textual or linguistic nuances. The question is one of the overall impression of each Episode.\",\n          \"The respondents argued that the concept of property is a very broad one and has to be understood in light of the principle that the creditors are to have the benefit of \\\"every beneficial interest which the bankrupt has, every species of right or which by any possibility of profit can be made\\\": Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 at [78] (citing re Buckle (1969) 15 FLR 460 at 466). 24 The respondents contended that the applicant's proceeding falls within s 116(1)(b) and thus s 58 because the proceeding involves the capacity to exercise powers in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit. Thus it is that the proceeding, the respondents contended, vests in the trustee.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203\",\n          \"Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574 \",\n          \"Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nouns\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (\\\" Daihatsu \\\") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.\",\n          \"The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: \\\"(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action.\\\" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it \\\" undermines or perverts \\\" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some \\\" unwritten law \\\" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.\",\n          \"The Tribunal found that \\\"it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion\\\" and that \\\"the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit\\\" . The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA (with whom McHugh JA agreed) in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (1987) 10 NSWLR 352, where his Honour said, at 365: \\\"In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution. It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles. It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board's commercial activities. The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue. Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution. To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area, guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and, in ordinary language, working for that religious institution. I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution.\\\" 57 This case does not aid the Commissioner. Its facts are distinguishable from the present case. It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute. The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds. Its purposes were thus defined by statute. This is to be contrasted with Word, which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies. The Board's manner of operation was also different from Word's. It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally, rather than the specific activities supported by Word. Finally, the Board claimed to be a religious institution not, as in the present case, a charitable institution. Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution. 58 In my view, in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion, the Tribunal fell into two errors. The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word's operations. There was no evidence to suggest that, from the commencement of Bethel Funerals, Word ceased receiving money from investors. The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word, not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word. Word's activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable. 59 When such a consideration is undertaken, the second error becomes clear. Word's purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations. This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals. It was only the manner of raising the money that changed; the purpose for doing it remained the same. The Tribunal's error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment. It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals, but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income. 60 The Tribunal's distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations. With the decline of the welfare state, charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources. Reliance on donations alone will, in many cases, be insufficient. Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities. There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f&ecirc;te and selling funeral services, but where the object of raising the funds is the same, I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two. I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at [33]-[35]. 61 It follows that, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2002, Word was a charitable institution under item 1.1 of the table at s 50-5 of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly. The cross-appeal is therefore allowed. Word's alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered. 62 As set out above at [16], Word established the Foundation from 1 July 2002 to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals. This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date, when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity. The Tribunal held that \\\"the activities after 1 July 2002, being the same as those prior to 1996, entitle [Word] to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"p_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203\",\n          \"Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574 \",\n          \"Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nouns\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_case_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24809,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"agreed elements of the action for breach of confidence are, for present purposes, that: (i) the information in question must be confidential in character: it must have \\\"the necessary quality of confidence about it\\\": Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203 at 215; (ii) it must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence: Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 at 47; Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37 at 40; and (iii) there must have been an actual or threatened unauthorised use or disclosure of that information: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 87, 111-112; Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222. See generally, Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets and Personal Secrets (2 nd ed, 2002); Toulson and Phipps, Confidentiality (2 nd ed, 2006).

Whether this attribute exists in a given case will be often a question of degree and a variety of criteria have been invoked in varying contexts to sharpen the inquiry to be made: (i) is the information in question widely known, or publicly available in the relevant industry, trade, etc: Coco at 51; cf Ansell Rubber Co at 50; Titan Group Pty Ltd v Steriline Manufacturing Pty Ltd (1990) 19 IPR 353 at 381; (ii) has the confider made the information public by using it in its manufactured products and placing it on the market, or would the ascertainment of the information from the manufactured product by reverse engineering or otherwise require the expenditure of time, effort, money or experimentation: see eg Ackroyds (London) Ltd v Islington Plastics Ltd [1962] RPC 97 ; Aquaculture Corporation v New Zealand Green Mussel Co Ltd (1985) 5 IPR 357 at 379; (iii) did the confider produce or obtain the information only after the expenditure of time and/or money by way of research or in the application of skill and ingenuity; Saltman Engineering Co Ltd ; cf United Sterling Corporation v Felton [1974] RPC 162 ; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Ltd , at 117; could another person acquire or duplicate the information only by going through a like process: Cranleigh Precision Engineering Ltd v Bryant [1966] RPC 81 at 89-90; Ansell Rubber Co at 49; (iv) what steps has the confider taken to preserve the secrecy of the information and to prevent it becoming public knowledge: Amber Size &amp; Chemical Co Ltd v Menzel (1913) 30 RPC 433 at 438; Dean, at [3.165]-[3.175]; (v) is the information intrinsically valuable or is it valuable to the confider or to a competitor or other interested party: Surveys &amp; Mining Ltd v Morrison [1969] Qd R 470 ; Measures Brothers Ltd v Measures [1910] 1 Ch 336 ; and (vi) would a reasonable person in all the circumstances recognise the information to be the \\\"property\\\" of the confider: Deta Nominees Pty Ltd v Viscount Plastic Products Pty Ltd [1979] VR 167 at 191; Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd v Holloway (No 2) [1965] RPC 239 at 255. The alternative test the \\\"purpose\\\" test asks: Has confidential information been imparted for what was known, or ought reasonably to have been known, to be only for a particular purpose? If it has, its use must be limited to that purpose. This approach has commonly been used in cases in which confidential industrial information has been disclosed (usually under contract) to a manufacturer either by way of licence for a period or so as to manufacture a product for the confider: see Saltman Engineering , at 213; Nichrotherm Electrical Co Ltd v Percy [1956] RPC 272 at 280; Ackroyds (London) Ltd at 104; Torrington Manufacturing Co Ltd v Smith &amp; Sons (England) Ltd [1966] RPC 285. Its use extends beyond that context: see Interfirm Comparison (Australia) at 117; and Gurry \\\"Breach of Confidence\\\" in Finn (ed) Essays in Equity , 118 (1985); Smith Kline &amp; French , at 96. Turning to the claims against Dr Keung, it is asserted in the alternative that he owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton in virtue of the disclosure actually being made to him and breached that duty by the disclosure he made, or that he knowingly participated in AMC's breach of confidence in that he directed or procured AMC's breach and was liable therefore. I am prepared, for present purposes, to assume that Dr Keung owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. He was the actual recipient of information which he had reason to know was to be kept confidential, albeit he received it for AMC which in turn owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. If, for example, he used such information for his own private purposes which resulted in a gain for him or a loss to Hamilton, he would have been liable therefore at the suit of Hamilton: see Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd , at 213; and without the need for any circularity of action by joining AMC as a party. I need not consider AMC's liability in such a case for present purposes: cf Coulthard v South Australia [1995] SASC 4927 ; (1995) 63 SASR 531 at 535. Equally, I am prepared to assume that he would be liable to Hamilton on an accessorial liability basis for his intentional procurement of AMC's breach of confidence to Hamilton. In this I recognise that there is a significant body of discordant case law across the common law world on the question of the liability of directors who are participants in the wrongs of their company, whether that wrong be a breach of contract, a tort, or an equitable wrong: see the helpful discussion of this in relation to tortious liability in Anderson, \\\"The theory of the corporation and its relevance to directors' tortious liability to creditors\\\" (2004) 16 Aust Jo Corp Law 73; on the small company problem for directors, see Finn, \\\"Opening Remarks\\\" (1999) 27 Fed L Rev 171 at 177-180; see the discussion in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [113] - [147] ; and see Mortimore QC Company Directors Ch 27 (2009 OUP).\",\n          \"The Episodes must be considered in their entirety ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199 per Gibbs CJ).
